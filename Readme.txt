Anne Lister's Code as a Font. Since she wrote numbers as 'fourhundredtwenty' I made a crossover with the Font Mattone by Nunzio Mazzaferro.

Anne-Lister-J503-X-Mattone-Regular.otf includes A-Z and a-z and characters are made by Nunzio Mazzaferro.

How to install?
Download the .otf files or the whole repostry.
On Arch Linux fonts can manually be stored in "/usr/local/share/fonts". Copy the .otf file in there. You can use a subfolder.
On some Linux systems double click on the .otf file opens a helper to install them.
On Windows right-click on the .otf and choose "Install", I guess, I have not tried.


I used Glyphr Studio 1.14 and 2.4.4 and Inkscape. It is not professional but working and the licence allows to do an improved version.

Thanks to Jenny and Ruth, who helped me out with Anne Lister's Diary.
